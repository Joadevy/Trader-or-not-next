## Overview
Trader or not is a 'higher/lower game' with prices of different cryptocurrencies that you need to predict the way that the price of a random crypto will take in the next 5 seconds. If you make an accurate prediction, you'll score one point. However, if your prediction goes wrong, you'll lose all your points and have to start again from scratch.

Basically it's a reversion of an [old project](https://github.com/Joadevy/TraderOrNot) that I did only in vanilla JS when I was a beginner in frontend development. In that time It was difficult to achieve a nicely UI and functionalities because of the ton of work that I had to do with plain JS but now with more knowledge of it and the help of a framework like NextJS I could add more features that I would love in that time.
